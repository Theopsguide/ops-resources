# ops-resources
A collection of core tools and resources for effectively running an organization's operations. It now includes links for mastering Scrum and other Agile workflows.

The same list is also available in a machine-readable format at [resources.csv](resources.csv) so you can easily filter or script against it.

## Usage
Run `python scripts/csv_to_markdown.py` to convert `resources.csv` into a Markdown list.
You can regenerate this README in one step with:
`python scripts/csv_to_markdown.py > README.md`

To print only entries from a single category, run for example:
`python scripts/filter_resources.py --category "Finance & Accounting"`
